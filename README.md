**Paintball Royale** is a simple fast-paced multiplayer paintball shooter built using Unity. I am using this as a learning project. Thus updates will be added whenever I can ;)



## Features 🚀  
- **Multiplayer Gameplay:** Real-time multiplayer matches
- **Unique Arenas:** Explore colorful, low-poly environments designed for strategic play.  
- **Paintball Combat:** Tag opponents with projectiles, grenades, and environmental traps.  
- **Power-Ups:** Speed boosts, paint grenades, and more to spice up the gameplay.  
- **Interactive Obstacles:** Bounce off trampolines, hide behind cover, or paint the environment to gain an edge.
